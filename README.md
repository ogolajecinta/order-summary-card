## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) - For styles

### What I learned

My major areas of learning in this challenge was understanding the box model, how to apply margin and paddings around elements. I also learnt how to use css flex display property.

### Continued development

I have not mastered using media queries and had a lot of difficulties initially. Also the concepts of specificity in selectors and using css grid as an alternative for responsive design. 
Improving my CSS to SCSS

### Useful resources

- [Hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-margin-vs-padding) - This helped me understand the difference between margin and padding and when to use each of them.
